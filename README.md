# Calculator Application

This is a simple calculator application implemented in Python using the Tkinter library. It provides a graphical user interface (GUI) that allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations.

## Features

- Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations are supported.
- Numeric input through buttons or the keyboard.
- Clear button to reset the input and start a new calculation.
- Error handling for incorrect expressions.


## Prerequisites
Use requirements.txt to find the dependancies. If python 3.x installed on your system, then Tkinter library is already included in your Python installation. If not, install Homebrew from [https://brew.sh/], and try `brew install python-tk`

## How to Run

- Clone the repository or download the source code.
- Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.
- Run the following command to start the calculator:
`python calculator.py`

## Usage
- Enter the desired numbers and arithmetic operators using the buttons or keyboard.
- The entered expression will be displayed in the input field.
- Press the "=" button or press Enter to evaluate the expression and display the result.
- To clear the input field, click the "Clear" button.
